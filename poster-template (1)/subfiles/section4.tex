    {
        Our model has a high precision indicating that the model's predictions for that genre are mostly correct, minimizing the number of false positives.  The recall of the model is slightly lower but decent, missing only some true instances of a particular genre. The model's validation performance is close to the training performance indicating good generalization capability.
        \newline
        Future work includes experimenting with different feature set and hyper-parameter tuning to optimize the model performance. More advanced models could be explored to understand the sequence and context of texts.
